# Hello there!
My name is Charlie Sale. I am currently a sophomore at Purdue University West Lafeyette studying computer science.
I am passionate about software development and have been learning as much as I can since I was about 13 years old.

### Experience
- I have worked two full time internships at [Fusion Alliance](https://fusionalliance.com/).
- I am part of the [Duality Lab](https://davisjam.github.io/) headed by Prof. Jamie Davis at Purdue University
- I have a number of side projects and experiments (as you can see in all of my repositories)
